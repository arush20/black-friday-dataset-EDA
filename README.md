# Black Friday Sale Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

Welcome to the Black Friday Sale Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering project! In this project, I've performed an in-depth analysis of the Black Friday Sale dataset to uncover insights about customer behavior and preferences during the sale. Additionally, I've applied feature engineering techniques to enhance the dataset's utility for analysis and modeling.

## Introduction
The Black Friday Sale dataset provides valuable information about customer purchases during a special sales event. This project aims to explore the patterns and trends in customer behavior during the sale, and to create new features that can improve the predictive power of models using this dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains details about customer purchases during the Black Friday Sale, including attributes such as:
- User demographics (age, gender, occupation)
- Product categories
- Purchase amounts
- City category
- Stay in the current city years

## Exploratory Data Analysis
During the exploratory data analysis phase, the following tasks were undertaken:
- Visualization of purchase patterns based on user demographics and product categories
- Analysis of purchase amounts and their distribution
- Exploration of customer behavior by analyzing user attributes
- Identification of popular product categories and their relationship to user profiles

## Feature Engineering
To enhance the dataset's features for better analysis and modeling, feature engineering techniques were applied, including:
- Creating aggregated features to capture user-level behaviors and purchase trends
- Transforming categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding and label encoding
- Engineering new features that capture interactions between user attributes and product categories
